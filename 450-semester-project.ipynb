Using interactive data visualization techniques, we aim to present a comprehensive view of CO2 emissions over time, segmented by country, industry, and other relevant factors.\n","\n","#### Statement: \n","Food deserts, areas with limited access to affordable, nutritious food, have a significant impact on the health and well-being of communities. This project aims to address the issue of food deserts by visually representing their extent and impact on various communities.\n","\n","#### Solution:\n","Create a data visualization project that depicts the locations of food deserts, their boundaries, and the socio-economic and health-related consequences of living in these areas. The project should emphasize the importance of improving access to healthy food options in underserved communities."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-10-31T08:32:41.179417Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-10-31T08:32:41.179037Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-10-31T08:32:41.615767Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-10-31T08:32:41.614536Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-10-31T08:32:41.179387Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["['health-equity-and-financial-protection-indicators',
